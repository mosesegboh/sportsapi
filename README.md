#TO RUN APP
- clone fork from github
- Replace .env credential values with yours as shown in the .env.example file (let me know if you will like to use mine and I will email it to you).
- run npm install to install dependencies
- cd into dir
- nodemon start to start server- you can use POSTMAN or whatever tools you need to make calls.
- run npm test to run tests (Please make sure to pass the right 'id' parameters are passed for tests).
- Yaay!!! Happy review!!!!!

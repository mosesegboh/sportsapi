#TO RUN APP
- clone fork from github
- Replace .env credential object values with your own google translate credential as shown in the .env.example file (let me know if you will like to use mine and I will email it to you).
- run npm install to install dependencies
- cd into dir
- nodemon start to start server
- use POSTMAN or whatever tools you need to make API calls.
- Run app on http://127.0.0.1:5000/(the required endpoint)
- run npm test to run tests (Please make sure to pass the right 'id' parameters to the .env file otherwise test will fail).
- Yaay!!! Happy review!!!!
